# 🚀 Problem of the Week (POW)

“Consistency beats intensity. Let your GitHub speak for your growth.”

---

This repository contains my weekly solutions for the Problem of the Week (POW) coding challenge organized for B.Tech CSE Cluster-1 (Hons) students.

---

Each week, I’ll be solving 2–3 carefully selected coding problems that focus on:

- ✅ Efficient logic and optimized solutions

- ✅ Real interview-style challenges

- ✅ Core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts

 # Each week folder contains:

🖋 Code file(s) (with multiple solution approaches if possible)

---

# 📄 README.md explaining:

- Problem statement (short)

- Approach/Logic

- Time & Space Complexity analysis

- Example test cases

---

# 🛠 How I Solve Problems

- Understand the Problem – Read carefully, identify inputs/outputs.

- Brute Force First – Start with a simple solution.

- Optimize – Improve using DSA concepts and patterns.

- Analyze – Write down time & space complexity.

- Refactor – Clean code, better variable names, comments.

# 📈 Goal

To build a consistent coding habit, improve problem-solving under pressure, and make my GitHub a portfolio of growth.

# ✍️ Let’s code smart, not just hard! 💡
